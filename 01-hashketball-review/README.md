# Hashketball Review

## SWBATs
- Define TDD (Test Driven Development)
- Distinguish between data types in Ruby
- Show how to look up documentation for data types in Ruby
- Demonstrate the use of common Array methods: `each`, `map`, `select`, `find`
- Define the Single Responsibility Principle

## Outline
- [ ] Walk through hashketball code
- [ ] Discuss rspec, learn and Ruby gems in general
- [ ] Use `binding.pry` and `p` to debug our code
- [ ] Work on passing tests using TDD

Discuss problem solving strategies: 
- [ ] Read error messages
- [ ] Short feedback loop
- [ ] Break up the problem to steps in pseudocode

Discuss refactoring strategies:
- [ ] Helper methods
- [ ] Single Responsibility Principle
- [ ] DRY

## RSpec & TDD
RSpec is a `gem`: someone else's Ruby code that we can use in our projects.

Testing strategies:
- `rspec --fail-fast` handle one error at a time
- Red, Green, Refactor
- Make it work (shameless green), make it right, make it fast

Debugging tools:
- `binding.pry` - pause your code and test variables
- `p`, `puts`, `print` - print to terminal

## Ruby Data Types
What do we use these data types for? What methods can we call on them?

- String
- Integer
- Boolean
- Array
- Hash

## Enumerable Methods
What can we use each of these for? What will they return?
- `each`
- `map`
- `select`
- `find`

## Methods in Ruby
- Variable scope
- Implicit vs Explicit return
